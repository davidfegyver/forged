# Forged

OutSystems [https://www.outsystems.com/forge/list](Forge) is a collection of reusable modules, connectors, UI components, and business solutions for OutSystems low-code applications.

This repository includes information about forge modules, tries to find out what the different file types are and what they contain.
I'll try to research some from a security perspective, if malwares exists on this platform, or if their codes are secure. 

## Wordlists
This repository also includes some [wordlists](./wordlists) designed for mapping OutSystems-based web applications.
